## About <a name = "about"></a>

This repository was created as an attempt to learn and recreate the parameter estimation for Hidden Markov Models using PyTorch library. Included are models with Categorical and Gaussian emissions for both Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and Hidden Semi-Markov Models(HSMM). As en extension I am trying to include models where the parameter estimation depends on certain set of external variables, these models are referred to as Contextual HMM or Parametric/Conditional HMM where the emission probabilities/distribution paramters are influenced by the context either time dependent or independent.

[PYPI Package](https://pypi.org/project/chadhmm/)

The documentation on the parameter estimation and model description is captured in - now empty - [docs](https://github.com/GarroshIcecream/ChadHMM//tree/master/docs) folder. Furthermore, there are [examples](https://github.com/GarroshIcecream/ChadHMM//tree/master/tests) of the usage, especially on the financial time series, focusing on the sequence prediction but also on the possible interpretation of the model parameters.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GarroshIcecream/ChadHMM.git
   ```
2. Install from PyPi
   ```sh
   pip install chadhmm
   ```

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Please refer to the [docs](https://github.com/GarroshIcecream/ChadHMM//tree/master/docs) for more detailed guide on how to create, train and predict sequences using Hidden Markov Models. There is also a section dedicated to visualizing the model parameters as well as its sequence predictions.

## Roadmap <a name = "roadmap"></a>

- [ ] Hidden Semi Markov Models
  - [ ] Fix computation of posteriors 
  - [ ] Implementation of Viterbi algorithm for HSMM
  - [x] Fix mean and covariance update in HSMM
- [ ] Integration of contextual models
  - [ ] Time dependent context to be implemented
  - [ ] Contextual Variables for covariances using GEM (Genereliazed Expectation Maximization algo)
  - [ ] Contextual variables for Categorical emissions
- [ ] Implement different types of covariance matrices
  - [ ] Connect that into degrees of freedom
- [ ] Improve the docs with examples
    - [ ] Application on financial time series prediction
- [ ] Support for CUDA training
- [x] Support for wider range of emissions distributions
- [X] K-Means for Gaussian means initialization
- [x] Code base refactor, abstractions might be confusing

See the [open issues](https://github.com/GarroshIcecream/ChadHMM/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
